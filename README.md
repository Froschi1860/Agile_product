## Features
### Mood Tracking

### Tension Tracking 

Using a different simple slider scale, users can input how tense they feel on a scale of 1-10. For most accurate results, choose the number that represents the feelings at that exact moment. 

### Journaling 

While the primary focus of Myrmidon is to track mood and tension, it also offers journaling where one can write in more detail exactly how they are feeling. Unsure of what to write? No problem, Myrmidon offers a variety of writing prompts to choose from should you be in need of a little guidance or inspiration.
